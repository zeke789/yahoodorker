# yahoodorker beta version #

### Current version: just to get urls with parameters and all possible pages ###

- without proxies don't block IP because sleep but is more slow, if you want more speed just use good proxies
- add socks to socks4.txt
- if you use proxies add "proxies=proxy" without quotes as param in each requests.get() and requests.post()
   example response = requests.get(url[0], headers=headers, proxies=proxy ,timeout=6.45)
